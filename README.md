# cite-seq-protein-prediction
This project predicts surface protein expression from single-cell RNA-seq data (CITE-seq). I built a global modeling pipeline that combines biological priors, dimensionality reduction, and donor-aware validation to achieve robust generalization across heterogeneous cell populations.
